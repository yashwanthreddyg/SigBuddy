This app is built in 24hrs as part of a hackathon.
The app monitors GPS and signal strength simultaneously and warns emergency contacts of the user by sending them the user's location when the signal strength is low or critical.

The app has a future scope to provide caution messages to a user, warning him of places withut signal.
